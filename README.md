# Sierpinski Triangle

This project demonstrates a simple Sierpinski Triangle animation created using **Vanilla JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas**. It generates a fractalmpattern by repeatedly placing points halfway between a random vertex of the triangle and a current point, creating a randomized Sierpinski Triangle.

## How It Works

1. The canvas is initialized to cover the full viewport.
2. The three vertices of an equilateral triangle are calculated and drawn.
3. A random starting point is generated within the triangle.
4. A loop is used to create new points by selecting a random vertex of the triangle and placing the next point halfway between the current point and this vertex.
5. Colors are applied randomly to each point to create a colorful animation.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the animation.

## Future Improvements

- **User Controls**: Allow user control over the number of points or color options.
- **Interactivity**: Add user interaction to change colors or reset the animation.
